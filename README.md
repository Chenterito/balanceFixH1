# balanceFixH1
Script that fixes the automatic balance of teams, it works only in 1-round game modes, since at the moment H1-mod in round-based games loads the scripts in each round.

Since version H1-Mod v2.0.0! it is no longer necessary.
The auto balance was fixed.

# How to implement.
Copy the folder ""balanceFix" into "h1-mod\scripts" of your server folder.
